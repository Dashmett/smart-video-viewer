Focus on web video in Safari: center and enlarge the existing player, dim the page, adjust playback speed, and seek by a configurable interval. You can also request playback in IINA.

**Current version: 2.0.6.** The extension and companion app retain the name **Smart Open in IINA**. This independent project is not affiliated with Apple or IINA and does not call private Safari Video Viewer APIs.

## Features

- In-page viewing that preserves the original video element and playback position, with horizontal and vertical centering.
- Playback speed from 0.1–16×. Slider, spinner and keyboard increments are 0.1×; the numeric field also accepts other values.
- Configurable seeking from 0.1–600 seconds; the default is 5 seconds.
- A glass-style console that hides automatically and reappears only when the pointer returns to its area. Keyboard shortcuts do not reveal it.
- Click the picture to play/pause; click outside it or press Esc to exit.
- Video discovery in authorized cross-origin frames and open Shadow DOM.
- Open-in-IINA, native picture-in-picture and fullscreen controls.

The console uses CSS, not native Liquid Glass components. The current interface is primarily in Chinese; this English README does not imply an English UI is available.

## Get and build

A [v2.0.6 preview DMG / ZIP](https://github.com/Dashmett/smart-video-viewer/releases/tag/v2.0.6) is available for **Apple Silicon only**. It is ad-hoc signed and unnotarized, requires Safari development-testing setup, and is not guaranteed to run immediately after download. See the [installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md). No Developer ID distribution build or App Store version is available.

Alternatively, build from source:

You need macOS, Safari and Xcode. The deployment target is macOS 12.0, not a fully tested compatibility guarantee: validation has primarily used the maintainer’s macOS 27 / Safari environment. Older versions have not received full device coverage. IINA is optional unless you use external playback.

1. Clone and open the project:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dashmett/smart-video-viewer.git
   cd smart-video-viewer
   open "Smart Video Viewer/Smart Open in IINA.xcodeproj"
   ```

2. Select your own Signing Team for both the app and extension targets in Xcode. Adjust both bundle identifiers if Xcode reports a conflict. The project retains local development settings; you need your own valid signing configuration.
3. Select the **Smart Open in IINA** scheme and **My Mac**, then build and run.
4. Open Safari extension settings from the companion app, enable **Smart Open in IINA**, and grant access only to the websites you want to use.
5. Refresh an existing video page, let its player load, click the toolbar icon, select a video, and enter the viewer. Cross-origin players also need permission for the embedded domain.

See Apple’s [creation guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating-a-safari-web-extension) and [distribution guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/distributing-your-safari-web-extension) for signing and distribution.

## Keyboard shortcuts

These apply to the in-page viewer. Text-field editing and system modifier shortcuts are excluded.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ← / J, → / L | Seek backward / forward by N seconds |
| Space / K | Play / pause |
| [ / ] | Decrease / increase speed by 0.1× |
| R | Reset to 1× |
| M | Toggle mute |
| F | Native fullscreen |
| Esc | Exit the viewer |

Exiting restores the previous page layout, native controls and playback speed. Configure defaults in the popup; adjust current playback in the console. The [detailed usage guide](Smart%20Video%20Viewer/Smart%20Open%20in%20IINA%20Extension/Resources/README.md) is currently in Chinese.

## Permissions and privacy

The extension requests website access, tabs, frame navigation, request observation, local settings storage and native messaging to discover videos, coordinate embedded players and launch IINA. `<all_urls>` supports different websites; Safari’s permission settings still determine actual access.

The current code includes no analytics, advertising SDK or developer-operated upload service. Preferences are local. Captured media URLs remain in background memory, are cleared on navigation and disappear when the process ends; signed URLs are not persisted. Choosing IINA passes the selected media URL to the local app, which may access the corresponding media server. See [Privacy](PRIVACY.md).

## Limitations

- No bypass of DRM, paywalls or website authorization. Cookie-, Referer- or signature-dependent streams may fail in IINA.
- A successful IINA launch request does not confirm successful playback.
- Closed Shadow DOM, canvas players and sites that replace video elements may be incompatible. Site-rendered subtitles, comments and menus outside the video element are not extracted.
- The browser and media determine effective rate support. Extreme rates may mute audio, stall playback or be reset by the website.
- Safari manages native fullscreen and picture-in-picture; custom controls and shortcuts may not apply there.
- No Chrome, Firefox, iOS or iPadOS installation packages are provided.

## Development and verification

Run the dependency-free checks with Node.js 22 or later:

```sh
node scripts/check.mjs
node --test "Smart Video Viewer/tests/background.test.mjs"
```

[GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/checks.yml) runs on pushes to main and pull requests, and can be triggered manually under Actions → Checks → Run workflow. The checks cover script syntax, resource references, version consistency and background regressions. **They do not replace real Safari end-to-end verification.** See [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for builds and manual checks.
